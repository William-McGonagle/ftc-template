    <h2>#4286 Dragonoids</h2>
    <p>
      The Dragonoids are in their ninth year with FTC and are based out of Greens Farms Academy in Greens Farms, Connecticut. We’re a group of nine dedicated individuals and friends who are very excited about this season of Skystone! Though the notebook may seem to indicate strict divisions of labor, all of our members work in the various subteams and there is a lot of collaboration between Build, Code, and Outreach. We only split them up into these three to simplify the process of organization and team structure.

    <h3>Highlights of this year’s Engineering Notebook:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Flip past our inside cover page to see the table of contents. There you can see the various parts of our notebook and the more detailed divisions of our notebook.</li><br>
      <li>We are especially proud of our outreach to the nearby communities in Fairfield County and our school, so please check out our tab on Outreach where more recently you will see our participation in the first competition and our plans for upcoming outreach events with future members at GFA.</li><br>
      <li>Make sure to check out the development of our movement system and prototyping for delivery systems under the Engineering/Build tab.</li><br>
      <li>See our progress in coding, especially for autonomous, that we are proud of as we learned how to use flow object detection and gyro sensors under our Code tab.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <p>We hope you enjoy a glimpse into our side of FTC here at Greens Farms and enjoy the competition!</p>
