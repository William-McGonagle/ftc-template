# Contributing
To contribute to the project, just email me to see what you can do to help. There is also a list of features that I think should be implemented in the future (it is under the features that have already been implemented). My email is wmcgonagle@optonline.net. 

If you do not have any coding knowledge, but would still like to contribute to the website in some way: think about doing some of the things mentioned below. 
- Tell other teams about this project.
- Make TouTube videos explaining how to set it up.
- Mention it in your engineering notebook or presentation.
- Thank the project if you win the competition.
- Share your team's website code with other teams.
